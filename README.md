# Portfolio_General

Welcome to my General Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of diverse data science and machine learning projects. Each project focuses on different aspects, datasets, and techniques, showcasing my skills and experience in the field.

## Projects Overview

### 1. [Simple Iris Dataset Visualization](./SimpleDataVisualization_withPlotly/README.md)

Explore visualizations of the Iris dataset using Plotly and Plotly Express. The project includes scatterplots, boxplots, histograms, and a comprehensive dashboard for interactive exploration.

### 2. [Scraping through Internet Knowledge](./ScrapingKnowledge/README.md)

Versatile web scraping scripts for extracting information from Google, Wikipedia, and Twitter. The example project, "What is Anarchy for the Internet?" demonstrates how to utilize these scripts for insightful analyses.

### 3. [A Simple Northwind Data Analysis Example](./PythonSQL_Northwind/README.md)

This example showcases a data analysis project focused on the Northwind database. It includes top product analysis, employee performance insights, and an interactive dashboard summarizing key metrics.

### 4. [NBA Players Analysis](./NBAPlayers_DataAnalysis/README.md)

An analysis of NBA players, including individual player insights, top players, teams, geographic distribution, and a championship overview. The project incorporates diverse visualizations, including maps and performance charts.

### 5. [Water Quality Prediction Project (Extended)](./ML_WaterQualityPrediction/README.md)

Developed machine learning models for predicting water quality based on an extended dataset. The project includes data sampling, visualizations, implementation of Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors models, and model evaluation metrics.

### 6. [A Simple KMeans Marketing Segmentation](./SimpleKMeans_Marketing/README.md)

Developed machine learning models for explore customer segmentation using data from a mall. The goal is to understand customer behavior, identify distinct customer segments, and derive insights for targeted marketing strategies.
