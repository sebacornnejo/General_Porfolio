## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, including features such as Annual Income, Spending Score, Age, and Gender. The data is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kandij/mall-customers).

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset is segmented to understand its main groups, for this the "elbow method" and visual exploration are used.

## Customer Segmentation

Apply clustering algorithms to segment customers based on features like Annual Income and Spending Score. Evaluate and interpret the clusters to understand customer groups and their characteristics.

## Gender Analysis

Analyze the distribution of customers based on gender within each cluster. Understand how gender is distributed in different customer segments.

## Results and Insights

Provide insights gained from customer segmentation and gender analysis. Discuss potential marketing strategies based on identified customer segments.
