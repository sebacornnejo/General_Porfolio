Democracy? It‚Äôs anarchy it‚Äôs sad it‚Äôs hopeless  It is so important to have a voice to be free but not when it is used to the detriment of others He can talk all he want! All he wants is to replace the rules with rules that fit himself (alas his ego) better. He still need to set rules, because then it will otherwise be anarchy. And WHY when he have set those rules should anyone else wanna follow them and if they dont, what Libya is in actual anarchy so why do people expect it to be a safe passage? What do you expect from a country where those in power now raped their previous leader to death with metal pipes? Africans need to take some responsibility for putting themselves in harms way.

The once-joyful pulses of the jellycubes turned into chaotic vibrations, and a ripple of unease spread through the candy-colored kingdom. Faced with this unexpected turmoil, the jellycubes convened at the heart of their realm, seeking answers.   Their luminous cores pulsed with worry as they discussed the strange events that had befallen them. Unable to decipher the mysteries of the rift, the jellycubes summoned their most astute scientist Elaric, hoping for a solution. This is giving licence to anarchy. This decision MUST be overturned. Where are the MPs protesting about this? Since when was the destruction of someone else's property lawful? We did more axe and knife throwing and archery at our monthly campouts.

Not just the BIG  stuff neither I know, but unironically, still yes. my toxic habit is preferring the megadeth cover of anarchy in the U.K, for two things: a) dave mustaine gets the lyrics wrong several times to very amusing effect b) it's actually played by a competent band It‚Äôs a jab. There‚Äôs no right wing talking point that can‚Äôt be shown to be antithetical to the wellbeing of the US. So, taking that and their idea of loving the US the juxtaposition and dichotomy is too amusing for me to pass up. How much of an asshole are you? No, I'm not just stating fact. Oh.

Since #Ancap is trending, I felt it pertinent to educate those who might have their curiosity piqued following @JMilei's win in Argentina.  First, the word "anarchy" is misunderstood by most to mean chaos, disorder, and lawlessness. This is actually the very opposite of the word's definition. As I cover in my book, "The Liberty Solution," the entomology of the word goes back to the ancient Greek word "arkhia" (Œ±œÅœáŒØŒ±), meaning "king or ruler." The prefix an- simply applies the negative, so "anarchy" means "without a king or ruler." This is the same Greek root word from which we get the word monarchy (meaning one ruler) and hierarchy (meaning holy rulers).  Anarchy means that no individual or entity has any level of ownership over your life, your body, and the fruits of your labor. It means individualism and self ownership. Statism, which is what currently exists, is the Utopian idea that just the right people controlling just the right amount of centralized violence can coerce people into my line of thinking, and the world will be better as a result. That is the very definition of slavery. Anarchy means that every individual is in charge of their own lives. That is the very definition of liberty.  Capitalism also is a concept misunderstood by many. It is thought of to be an exploitative system designed to make the rich richer, and the poor poorer. This, again, is the opposite of its definition. Capitalism is the use of property for the profit of the individual (aka YOU). Property is not just the personal possessions a person has, it is also their body and labor. To invest your personal capital for profit (e.g. voluntarily exchange your skills to a company for a wage) is to engage in capitalism.  In short, capitalism is nothing more than the free and voluntary exchange of private property. There are no bailouts. There is no such thing as "too big to fail." There is only your property and its growth based on objective merit.  I would welcome you to read my book, "The Liberty Solution," for a deeper dive into anarcho-capitalism. The link is in my pinned tweet. Anarchism should be the future for which we all strive. Maybe one day soon, we can achieve it, and truly live our lives as we see fit. Precisely. But BTC isn't different than some other cryptos. It's just the first big one.   For example, you could easily create a very similar coin to Bitcoin and it would be called a shit coin. Probably rightfully so. Hypocrisy btw Aren't Netflix comedians generic now? At least this one hasn't went online complaining about being cancelled, I think. You could do a sitcom episode on my trip to Costco today. Complete anarchy. People waited 2+ hours for a pumpkin pie. Communism = planned/phased anarchy (in a nutshell)  According to Marx and Engels  On route to that stateless, moneyless, and classless society an open, transparent, and accountable democratic government must take the lead   Communism has not yet been achieved  Only various phases -That‚Äôs terrorism, nothing can justify that -Goes ahead justifying the same thing 10x bigger Will it isn't but it's up to the person who wants do that their no law or mandates for people to do that. I mean it doesn't hurt for the new gun owners to learn gun safety and get some training. But it's up the person to do that. Everything is 10% off!! Like this beautiful anarchy dogwood patch!

On one hand you've got overy corruption like FTX.  On the other hand you've got clear cases of government overreach like @LBRYcom.  The question is, why are so many crypto exchanges acting shady?   Is it standard corporate malfeasance being brought to light by government oversight? Or are the crypto people especially slimy?  It's hard to say for sure. Probably both.  Crypto is new and incredibly profitable. That brings in true believers as well as charlatans/scammers looking for a quick buck.  Long story short: don't trust anyone with your crypto keys.

Hailey Harms, a Marine spokesperson confirmed the crew was both diverse and alive. Because the MSM isn‚Äôt reporting the identity of the crew the community notes community decided my comment was wrong. Annoying and false. Before you apply a community note make sure you know what you‚Äôre talking about - your inability to confirm a statement isn‚Äôt proof it isn‚Äôt accurate. Note: This crew photo is just the one the Navy distributed to show how diverse its P-8 crews are. They did not share one of the P-8 crew that went for a swim. I‚Äôm not going lie!

What an exciting afternoon for all of us $ATOR holders seeing some uncharacteristic downwards action, I had almost forgotten what red candles looked like!  Firstly congratulations and well done to those that have held their nerve amongst this barrage of fud and the recent developments. ü§ù  To clarify for those not in the know, ToR was NEVER a necessity of $ATOR it would have been liked to have been endorsed but was never a necessity. ToR have shown their hand over the last few days, exposing their aged attitude towards resisting development and progress within their existing network, and now it is time for $ATOR to really stretch their legs. I would encourage people to hold their nerve and ride this out, but as always #NFA and you are free to make your own decisions based on the facts.  I have had confirmation from within the team that they will be forking ToR and carrying on with development but under their own peer to peer network, promising  better bandwidth, higher speeds, top end security and of course rewards for relay runners as was the original plan, without the political ties and handcuffs associated with the ToR network. What has taken ToR 20 years to build will take $ATOR a matter of months and this has been proven already in testnet phase.  These are an unfortunate set of events but ToR have played their cards and the team will progress without them, I wish ToR all the best.  Below is a statement released by the @atorprotocol team no more than 30 mins ago outlining their intentions. As outlined in the attached, the news that all of the fudders and little CT gremlins have crawled out from their rocks from to spread, has set the project back in price by a mere 30 days and if that doesn't confirm the strength and depth once again of this team then I'm not sure what will. The fact that other projects are SOOO desperate to try and tear $ATOR down is incredibly bullish in my opinion!  https://medium.com/@atorprotocol/building-the-future-of-internet-privacy-a-new-vision-3513454f602d Authority isn‚Äôt some benign use of force or imposition of will. Authority is first and foremost a social system which creates a centralized flow of power where one group is privileged with domain and control over a subordinate and exploited party Since the birth of Anarchism as a distinct political ideology, "Anarchy" has not meant simply "without rulers" Oh so now authority is when centralized social system? Thats not the definition you gave, its almost like you are manipulating words to suit your ends Feeling cute might delete later. Stood in the post office line today talking to the chap behind me as we awaited serving, Suddenly realised folk might have taken it as a sign for anarchy to ensue so just in time I looked straight ahead and fell into stony stoical silence.

Stop being a coward and just say that you already have reached your conclusions. Stop doing a fake Socratic method. You're just being manipulative. Anarchy truly is the most stable system of all systems we know. That one voluntarily read this tweet and considers whether or not they agree shows that they are participating in anarchy right now. 99% of a person's daily interactions with other people are anarchistic in nature. No, your administration is through excess taxation, excess spending, and excess inflation. Stfu tyrant. ‚ÄúActually resisting authority is itself authority bro, I am very smart and worth taking seriously‚Äù.   How does throwing a brick at a cop car create a centralized social system? This is ADL's game:  Their key weapon is the anti-semitism accusation. Once they pin that to someone's forehead, the only way out is give ADL what they want.  Usually it's cash. But with Musk, they extracted something more valuable: banning of political slogans Israel dislikes. Because we still believe in natural justice. The patience to discern good and evil and the ability to withstand the time to get the evil punished naturally is civilization's wisdom to avoid anarchy as is witnessed largely. my eyes have been opened, i gotta experience the art in its truest form kinger has been involved in a tragic car crash‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è CAUGHT ON TAPE  pomni is not a good driver  #TheAmazingDigitalCircus #TADC #Kinger #Pomni This account has been harassing @Skepticallefty for like 2 days.

That people ostensibly fighting for the rights and dignity of sex workers keep harassing you, insisting you're doing something wrong, shows they're not interested in protecting sex workers. They're interested in punishing them. @Uppolice: Anti-Muslim hate activities must b addressed promptly. Every citizen deserves a safe & inclusive environment. We request u take necessary actions, Arrest each & every Hate Peddling culprits to ensure justice prevails. #SafetyFirst #JusticeForAll #islamophobie #Anarchy 2023- Members of my own party and members of the right screenshot and sent my tweets and portions of my show to my job to try and get me fired. (They failed for the 4th time)  2022- Members of my own party and members of the left called and emailed the DHS to try and stop us from adopting the newborn baby brother of my oldest daughter and two adopted children. (It worked and the judge granted his foster parents custody while we were over half way done with their programs they required)   2021- Members of my own party and members of the left screenshot and sent my tweets and portions of my show to my job to try and get me fired. (They failed for a 3rd time)  2020- Members of my own party and members of the left used my oldest daughter as a weopon to try and hurt me by contacting her and her drug addled mother while I was trying to get full custody (for 10 years) and offering them money while in a bad situation to make bad statements about me while I was running for Chairman of the LNC. 4 months later, I would get full custody of my daughter and her two younger siblings who were not mine biologically, and she felt horrible. The same people would go on to calling DHS to try and get those kids taken away from us. (They failed)  Early 2020- Members of my own party and members of the left would reach out to my now wife while she was pregnant with our first son, and try to get her to leave me. They told her I was going to take the baby back to California and fight her for custody. They told her I was abusive and a nazi, etc. (They failed)  2019- Members of my own party would try to get me fired from my job. (They failed for a second time)   2018- Members of my own party concocted stories from nazism to sexual abuse, to harassment during my first LNC Chair run. Publications would run these stories in print and my job got hold of them. If it wasn't for my good receipt keeping, I would have been destroyed. Those people would have to go on to print retractions and apologies. (They failed for the first time)  Politics is a dirty, disgusting game where people do things to others in secret what they would never say or do to their faces. They will try and ruin your actual life over perceived differences of ideology and opinion. They will use your children, your familes, your livelihoods, etc. All for their own political game. It's one of the reasons I hate politics so much.   I am running to beat @RecTheRegime And I intend to do that, but being pulled from a publisher that supposedly prides itself on free speech for perceived differences of foreign policy opinion is disgusting. They and whoever pushed for this should be ashamed of themselves.   I'm sorry that Michael has to deal with this. That‚Äôs more like it "'mere' anarchy is loosed upon the world." You are my business Spread rumors !! Following the recipe is easier when the site isn't covered in pop-ups. Brave blocks ads and other annoyances so you can focus on your cooking.

That nerd has you weak in the knees but okay hoe Well then you are just using authority in a different sense then what anti-authoritarians typically advocate Can you fit though, Cinderella? It's some anarchy group, also pro-Palastina is not pro-Hamas, get your facts straight. Ok so anarchist are authoritarian glad we agree WHAT THE EGG?? thank you philza & philza's chat for jumpstarting this idea in my brain #technobladefanart #philzafanart How about we accept that we will never have fair representation in the broken system of canada, and we just leave? Why should we respect any laws of dictates when we have no input in them? Let's leave and fix our province before it is lost forever. This is the playlist image for the Chapter 4 Finale event!

Lol lmao. You're just an anti vaxxer and a centrist. You're not asking genuine questions. You've reached your conclusions. You're opposed to trans youth medical care, you're already opposed to Medicare for All. You are just JAQing off... I.e. anarchists argue that power should be shared amongst a freely associated rank and file. Violence toward that end wouldn‚Äôt constitute authority in the same sense as using violence to reinforce some centralized schema where elites have all the power. I need!!!!!! We could debate it and agree on 90% of the nonsense. Unfortunately, we are debating people who can't differentiate between a man and a woman. That Klaus Schwab and his "anarchy plan" is working perfectly. LFG ANARChY üê∫ Removing me as president over failure to score 25% in Abuja may trigger anarchy in Nigeria, Tinubu warns tribunal @amnesty @antonioguterres @NOIweala @UKinNigeria #FreeNnamdiKanu #EndNigeriaNow i know this barely counts but whatever Derek Chauvin is a convicted murderer. We all saw the video. It's like an alternate reality where most people are struggling just to eat, layoffs are increasing, rampant illegal border crossings are ignored, inflation is high, debt is high, anarchy is ruining our cities and our tax dollars are being squandered in foreign conflicts. Huh. The LAPD riot squad is out in front of a mansion hosting a Kamala Harris‚Äô fundraiser. To protect rich donors from people calling for a ceasefire. Who is we? Because you were talking about blaming the mother and calling her a coward who hates children. Don‚Äôt change your narrative. Tough shit, losers. Get to work. Is my maths wrong? If, instead of GIVING Rwanda ¬£140 million, the UK had employed 3,500 people to work on asylum applications at two each per week over a 40 week year they could have cleared the asylum backlog and saved ¬£2.9 BILLION (8 million per day on hotels). I‚Äôve got mutuals id drink many beers with and I got mutuals I hope I have a taser if I ever run into them. Some of y'all need theory and it shows... The fact is peace in the Middle East can be accomplished after the terrorist groups are permanently destroyed that are causing anarchy,civil wars, mass genocide. I've spent a week mostly on bed. Ah. stop it body. 3rd base Well you‚Äôll be seeing anarchy pretty soon. So you get back to me. Viennale 2023 Review: ABOUT THIRTY (ARTURO A LOS 30), Young and Restless in Buenos Aires dlvr.it/Sz7Kbm Anyone who pays $90 for a turkey could only be a republican. They make no thought choices every day. Mike Elko makes $3.5 MILLION a year! He can leave anytime he wants to for a better job. Yet, he thinks the transfer portal & NIL is anarchy.  He‚Äôs fine with coaches making MILLIONS with the autonomy to leave at will. But it‚Äôs a problem when players do the EXACT same thing‚Ä¶ Absolutely not. Ele deve ser membro dos "Sons of Anarchy".

There might be 97 per cent of Muslims not graduated  But no one is sold out and coward like you @Shehla_Rashid That actually isn't a risk if the state does not exist. The only monopolistic risk that exists in anarchy is if one company adequately supplies the market a good or service where the market is satisfied with the lone producer... And there is nothing wrong with that.  People underestimate the power of the market (i.e. consumers). If any negative monopoly were to exist (absent the state), then new competition will enter the market and challenge them. The market will flock to the new firm and reject the old one. The Palestine football team during the national anthem prior their World Cup Qualifier against Australia this afternoon üáµüá∏ Ah ah ah. Stop bullshitting. You don't want to just control people purchasing sex services. You want to punish sex workers indirectly so that nobody wants to do sex work. Not that that'd work but that's what you're trying to do. What you‚Äôre doing is the same strawman and equivocation that‚Äôs been debunked forever. When we talk about authority we aren‚Äôt just talking about some general use of force or will. We‚Äôre talking about social relations in which ppl are denied agency at the behest of others. Why he is in a fight for his life and the perp was armed. He can't know it's a stun gun. LA has degenerated into total anarchy and all police should pull out. This is madness. when will the skins drop? You're all so close to being converted.   Laws can not be disobeyed.  Rulers create rules.  Rules must be disobeyed.   Anarchy is now. It is not some far off, utopia.   Why are so many in an abusive relationship with the government?  Break up with her and move on.   Quit talking about your abusive ex.   Side note: I get why a single woman would be a minarchist. Women need someone to lead them. Get a husband, lady. Being a librarian doesn‚Äôt mean anarchy. Allowing racism and Nazism to fester in college campuses isn‚Äôt a divine right. Especially when these radical hate groups have ties to Hamas!
