Democracy? It’s anarchy it’s sad it’s hopeless  It is so important to have a voice to be free but not when it is used to the detriment of others He can talk all he want! All he wants is to replace the rules with rules that fit himself (alas his ego) better. He still need to set rules, because then it will otherwise be anarchy. And WHY when he have set those rules should anyone else wanna follow them and if they dont, what Libya is in actual anarchy so why do people expect it to be a safe passage? What do you expect from a country where those in power now raped their previous leader to death with metal pipes? Africans need to take some responsibility for putting themselves in harms way. They took those 30 min to figure out how to pronounce CZs name I mean if they steal a pink bike with a basket, that’s on them to ride it in public 😅 In the whimsical Jelly Realm, where jellycubes frolicked in jelly delight, a sudden tear in the sky disrupted the harmonious dance of the gelatinous inhabitants.   The once-joyful pulses of the jellycubes turned into chaotic vibrations, and a ripple of unease spread through the candy-colored kingdom. Faced with this unexpected turmoil, the jellycubes convened at the heart of their realm, seeking answers.   Their luminous cores pulsed with worry as they discussed the strange events that had befallen them. Unable to decipher the mysteries of the rift, the jellycubes summoned their most astute scientist Elaric, hoping for a solution. This is giving licence to anarchy. This decision MUST be overturned. Where are the MPs protesting about this? Since when was the destruction of someone else's property lawful? We did more axe and knife throwing and archery at our monthly campouts. You remember that weird anti-Iman Vellani video the right wing YouTubers were pushing that just lied about her reaction?  Yeah, even the right wingers are calling that BS. You really are a big fan of terrorist anarchy. @FBI check this one out. DC ANARCHY: "H Street" was once a symbol of D.C.’s rebirth. Now it’s barely holding on due to crime and drugs. https://wapo.st/3unfohY It definitely was. That was the straw that broke the camels back and the locker room was on the brink of anarchy Eagle Scout, actually. Sure why not 【 TONIGHT @ 4PM CDT 】  i'm diving deep into RPG maker history with my FIRST EVER playthrough of mad father!! let's get this shit  ⚡️  💙 💛 💚 Yes, they got arrested engaging in pointless violent anarchy because they are angsty over their Trump loving parents. The irony is they sound just like their Trump loving parents. They are the Manson Family 2.0 That's literally you guy. That's not changing my story that's a stating the fact and obvious you're the one don't know how the public thread works on social media... Or hurting your back by just sleeping. Just in case your wondering why they are trying to ban red meat.. wait, it wasn't meant to be a one story deal? Honestly, we don’t need donations, we need X to remove the raging antisemitism and users that repeatedly spread lies from the platform. Free speak is not anarchy.  Even radical free speak should not include mass distraction of vile lies and user that call for genocide. NIGERIA GRADUALLY HEADING TO A STATE OF ANARCHY That's not backpelling that's just stating fact and Truth. The only way it's going to be mandatory is to vote it in to a law you do realize how laws works in this country right Oh no! I hope it didn't cause a lot of mess 😱 #NotAloneTalk This is the way I was initially charitable thinking “complex subjects really shouldn’t be put on a flowchart like you’re mapping out your employee onboarding process” And then I heard this guy speak, I do not think he could define capitalism. I think theres tiny creatures eating his brain matter 4. I believe in Anarchy of Being. No one person is smarter or superior to any other person overall. We all have the same cognitive ability, but shaped by experience and social pressure, we each exert our attentions to different topics. Not just the BIG  stuff neither I know, but unironically, still yes. my toxic habit is preferring the megadeth cover of anarchy in the U.K, for two things: a) dave mustaine gets the lyrics wrong several times to very amusing effect b) it's actually played by a competent band It’s a jab. There’s no right wing talking point that can’t be shown to be antithetical to the wellbeing of the US. So, taking that and their idea of loving the US the juxtaposition and dichotomy is too amusing for me to pass up. How much of an asshole are you? No, I'm not just stating fact. Oh. Sounds like a back peddle buddy.   Sounds like you also don’t give a shit about public safety.   Make it mandatory is the only way it would actually work. Again, it's a public thread where anyone can reply on it.. What don't you understand about this? Miles Morales is Spider-man Peter Parkere is the Amazing Bag man kris, oc and best friends after kris’ return at arcade anarchy The Anarchy Stronghold by Vistanz #VRChat #MadeWithVRChat https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_92f7c812-c14e-41c6-9f0a-8de1a04cd48b World: The Anarchy Stronghold Author: Vistanz @JLChnToZ #VRC #VRChat_world紹介 #VRChatPhotography #VirtualPhotography #VRChatワールド紹介 #vrchatworld #VRchatはじめました #VRChat What is anarcho-capitalism?  Since #Ancap is trending, I felt it pertinent to educate those who might have their curiosity piqued following @JMilei's win in Argentina.  First, the word "anarchy" is misunderstood by most to mean chaos, disorder, and lawlessness. This is actually the very opposite of the word's definition. As I cover in my book, "The Liberty Solution," the entomology of the word goes back to the ancient Greek word "arkhia" (αρχία), meaning "king or ruler." The prefix an- simply applies the negative, so "anarchy" means "without a king or ruler." This is the same Greek root word from which we get the word monarchy (meaning one ruler) and hierarchy (meaning holy rulers).  Anarchy means that no individual or entity has any level of ownership over your life, your body, and the fruits of your labor. It means individualism and self ownership. Statism, which is what currently exists, is the Utopian idea that just the right people controlling just the right amount of centralized violence can coerce people into my line of thinking, and the world will be better as a result. That is the very definition of slavery. Anarchy means that every individual is in charge of their own lives. That is the very definition of liberty.  Capitalism also is a concept misunderstood by many. It is thought of to be an exploitative system designed to make the rich richer, and the poor poorer. This, again, is the opposite of its definition. Capitalism is the use of property for the profit of the individual (aka YOU). Property is not just the personal possessions a person has, it is also their body and labor. To invest your personal capital for profit (e.g. voluntarily exchange your skills to a company for a wage) is to engage in capitalism.  In short, capitalism is nothing more than the free and voluntary exchange of private property. There are no bailouts. There is no such thing as "too big to fail." There is only your property and its growth based on objective merit.  I would welcome you to read my book, "The Liberty Solution," for a deeper dive into anarcho-capitalism. The link is in my pinned tweet. Anarchism should be the future for which we all strive. Maybe one day soon, we can achieve it, and truly live our lives as we see fit. Precisely. But BTC isn't different than some other cryptos. It's just the first big one.   For example, you could easily create a very similar coin to Bitcoin and it would be called a shit coin. Probably rightfully so. Hypocrisy btw Aren't Netflix comedians generic now? At least this one hasn't went online complaining about being cancelled, I think. You could do a sitcom episode on my trip to Costco today. Complete anarchy. People waited 2+ hours for a pumpkin pie. Communism = planned/phased anarchy (in a nutshell)  According to Marx and Engels  On route to that stateless, moneyless, and classless society an open, transparent, and accountable democratic government must take the lead   Communism has not yet been achieved  Only various phases -That’s terrorism, nothing can justify that -Goes ahead justifying the same thing 10x bigger Will it isn't but it's up to the person who wants do that their no law or mandates for people to do that. I mean it doesn't hurt for the new gun owners to learn gun safety and get some training. But it's up the person to do that. Everything is 10% off!! Like this beautiful anarchy dogwood patch!

NXT Battleground, hey so we will at least remember AEW double or nothing. (god that horrible ppv but the 4 way pillars & anarchy in the arena was fire) So it doesn't matter if you where or wasn't. It's public thread. And it does you do falsely accused people you disagree with I mean it's clearly all over your replies... I mean you're x page is public? Again, do you know how social media works? And you're racist Mean tweets anyone????? The 'Conservative' Party is in far more trouble than widely reported in the press. They face near wipeout at the next election, losing in the process a great deal of their Parliamentary talent (such as it is). Let's crunch numbers to show what a mess they're in.  1/n #SupermanLegacy Going Off!!

Robert Nozick (author of ANARCHY, STATE & UTOPIA) was that. No, Milei is a new Videla in libertarian clothing determined to end the mere possibility of Argentinian democratic sovereignty. As for dollarisation vs inflation, it is like nuking a country to get rid of Covid-19. Argentinians deserve our solidarity in the nightmare they are about to descend. Well I’m starved! Who wants some jambalaya If the zionists are triumphant, there will be an East West split like never before. Beleaguered South America will be at the fascist NAZIS mercy.  Asia = accelerated ascendancy while the yank dynasty crumbles to nothing following full on Fascist Anarchy by hoi polloi....Oh dear Doesn't make him any less of an idiot for sharing something so fucking stupid It ignores history?  There is no history of anarchy.  The only history there is is of the state and war. I just couldn't imagine such a big studio giving one guy so much power. but also they haven't moved very intelligently lately lol That's false the majority of them care about it. You just think their carrying is ridiculous when it's not. No issues here. You were replying to me.. What you don't know how the replying thing works on here? It wouldn't hurt for the beginner to get some training and licensing I didn't say it should be mandatory but in some states it is. But that's the law guy. and by "the one with the old artstyle", I'm referring to this Bwana Wafu. This goes beyond youths. The man I nearly lost money to is a grandfather. This wave of dishonesty is both a sociocultural and institutional breakdown. Man is naturally selfish. Without external checks, all you are left with is anarchy. This is Uganda right now.

We decided to keep the theme and go with the name Jax, short for Jackson.   Officially meet Jax... ARTISTS show me how you stylize black hairstyles!! You sure brought it on, block and run. 😆 Give Sons of Anarchy a run. Great show!! I do find it interesting how the most successful left intellectual of the Progressive Era is a complete nobody because his policies were practical and effective, rather than agitations toward anarchy or totalitarianism.

Used to grill on those when I was on per in hotels without grills. Just left it behind. 23,000 civilians were killed during the battle of Aleppo in four years of fighting. ~10,000 civilians have been killed by Israel in a single month. This guy is completely clueless I got one friend who loves to bully me over this but Chumbawamba. The entire Tubthumper album is banger after banger, and Anarchy? WYSIWYG? Solid gold. I only stay in hotels with outdoor grills. One of the 24 quests in Drinking Quest: Six Pack is all about slime I’m literally right here lol We cannot afford to throw the nation to a state of anarchy, thats why some of us will tone down your approaches to incite violence and instigate the people against the government.

Yet, I have always said if you thinking about being a firearm owner you need to know gun safety and be trained to know how to use it when necessary. Hell yeah I do! Bruh you can go to pretty much any chain grocery store and get a turkey for under $.50lb if you spend like $35😂 Can't get enough of videos of people driving through protesters blocking free travel.

Derived from the Greek root anarchos meaning “without authority,” anarchism, anarchist, and anarchy are used to express both approval and disapproval.  So looking at the Anarchy symbol….it reminded me of the combined Aleph and omega symbols…..what say you When cops are afraid of the public, or as it seems, a certain demographic, anarchy is the logical outcome.

It was her friend, his gf. lol Yep Murder-Ducks need to be a thing. Give the Voter IDs away for free and I'm on board. I've only done in person games.  They feel more energetic with people in the room with you. Sorry There's a lot of geographic variation in preference for "ESG" type investments from big investors. Broadly French names are at one extreme, US and Asian at the other; UK domestic probably tilts slightly anti ESG. Managers try to tailor their products to who they think has money. Thinking a lot about centralization and decentralization these few days. The cultural enricher throws a scooter at a car, attacks a defenseless woman on a bicycle and then runs away but is chased and caught by a brave boy who educates him. I promise you it is not breaking news that Tortuguita hated cops and prisons. Nor should hating cops and prisons justify being shot 57 times in cold blood by the police, no matter how many hit pieces the @ajc publishes to try to justify their murder. I hear ya. Is it possible for you to try and organize a union at your job?

I'm sorry for your loss, Gamma. ❤️ Thoughts? Thank you for over 100,000 followers!!🥳 "Anarchy is awesome" ah yes, the only other option besides authoritarianism 😭  Also I accidentally pressed on their profile and their pinned tweet 🫣🔫 Anarchy in startup land - but what a quarter for Elon.  1. Tesla:  Cruise suspended in SF, CEO steps down   2. X AI:  Grok release. OpenAI board completely incompetent. Sam fired, Greg quits, OpenAI and Microsoft partnership in absolute disarray  3. X/Twitter:  2022 takeover gets vindicated by the unprecedentedly raw, unbiased coverage of the terrorist attacks / war in Israel and Gaza. X reaffirms its status as the go-to news platform during this OpenAI debacle  4. SpaceX:  Successful Starship launch, paving the way for orbit soon  5. Neuralink:  FDA clearance for human trials If I Make a Sound I Die (Don't Scream) https://piped.video/er-g9D-4n88 My column: "Chicago media will not link Democrat Boss Toni Preckwinkle to the growing epidemic of crime, or connect the dots to George Soros and Kim Foxx. Those responsible for the anarchy and chaos won’t be held to account. And that is how a city dies." https://johnkassnews.com/can-holiday-shopping-co-exist-with-violent-crime/ Miami didn’t have riots.   Dallas, Houston, St. Louis, and other major cities in red states were chaotic.   Blue states descended into anarchy.   DeSantis works closely with and has the respect of Florida law enforcement. He passed the most strict anti-riot laws in the country.   He removed two of the Soros DAs that have destroyed many blue cities. No one else has.   It’s a huge mistake to not get this message out in the debates. Those who need to hear it won’t if he doesn’t. the global south has descended into anarchy, the capitalist core into the ghastly decadence of bare life Leftists are awful. Liberals are necessary for us to have a great nation.   Right wingers are awful. Conservatives are necessary for us to have a great nation.   Communism/fascism/anarchy isn’t acceptable because they hate our country.   Liberalism and conservatism are aiming for the same goal, just different approach. Meanwhile in Gaza, 75% of the population has been bombed or driven out of their homes. Now they face unending starvation and disease, while shivering wet in the cold. Cultural enricher in Italy wants to travel without a ticket: "Fu*k you! You have no respect! I don't pay and I don't get off!" This is ethnic cleansing. To deny that at this point is to deny reality. OBJ is of recent making inciting and unguided statements that can cause anarchy. This is definitely not the way to be an elder statesman! OBJ is like WS described him as king of hypocrites. Agbalagba ki n wa ni oja ki ori omo tuntun wo. OBJ is losing every myth and respect in him 😂😂😂 I don’t suppose tinubu, i just want a good and stable Nigeria. I’m sorry if i don’t preach the anarchy gospel you love Honestly Bryan Danielson has a top 10 matches of 2023 than surpasses 99% of wrestler’s career top 10:  Takeshita Bandido Rush MJF Anarchy in the Arena Starks x2 ZSJ Swerve Christian   The man isn’t human Look.tell his supporters I think I have the answer to there problems what I want to know or u for or against America because y'all were hit with a LRAD system this the radio frequency hmm that was heard it was done by terrorists who want to start anarchy truth check facts 🆘🆘HELLO??!! the content we deserve. Louis getting his anarchy finger tattoo done. You see, I'm a man of simple taste. I enjoy dynamite, and gunpowder, & gasoline. Let's introduce a little anarchy! Upset the established Order, & everything becomes a revolution. I'm an Agent of Chaos, & you know the thing about uncertainty? It make us alive! #ReleaseTheAyerCut🧨 The fraternal order of police ain't going to support anarchy.. Listen.. This is the guy with the flag. What a creeeeeeeeeep I'm never forgiving the world for forcing palestinians to film these moments so they can believe their pain. fuck the entire world the curse strikes again nah the light laugh is crazy lmao Make it crunchy and I won’t stop eating let me make it clear, once i support one party, will that give the non-supporters the right to act like that? because of that, there would be anarchy on earth writers: i wish i could art :( artists: i wish i could word :( Trader Joe’s got em for $3 😳 @UBACares pls reply Dm o Tho sometimes there are just totally random worldwide intellectual fads.  Look at the anarchists in the early 20th century.  It was a totally nuts idea without any central organization or proselytizing but yet people were willing to die in the name of anarchy in many nations. anarchy is stupid @UBACares seems this is the only way to get y’all attention. Pls reply your Dm abeg Literate portrayal of Alexandra Morrow, a Sons of Anarchy, Original Character   older version of , @theothermorrow   Penned by: #DevilishCro Anarchy got you down?

Sentencing date TBD. Govt motion for remand is GRANTED. Laura Trott says the government is going to break the law (a law that is based on a charter initiated by Tory leader Churchill himself). So that makes it ok for everyone else to break the law #anarchy #ToriesDestroyTheGFA #UKfascism HHHHHHH I LOVE THIS!!! I have nothing but respect for a fellow transportation worker. usually draw this guy as a pig but anything for jessie #technobladefanart #dsmpfanart The situation in Lampedusa is always out of control. A huge boat with 600 Muslim cultural enrichers invaded the island with 12 other small boats for a total of 900 invaders in a few hours. In the last 12 months, over 200,000 Muslim invaders have landed in Italy, 99% of them men of military age. Why don't they go to an Arab country? This madness must be stopped. A German family who hosted the cultural enricher tries to make him leave but he becomes threatening with a knife in his hand. Why did they host him? First look at SPIDER-MAN: BEYOND THE SPIDER-VERSE (@SpiderVerse) Sons of Anarchy Walking Dead Breaking Bad That 70s Show We don't care about c02 emissions, they are not pollution and are vital for life. Stop the grift. Even better get us out of the failed state of canada. Someone just pointed out to me that in an Eminem music video, he is literally puking out Legos LOL Bursting forth Anarchy and civil disobedience. ok you’ve convinced me I’ll be there There's a Steam sale, and a lot of the games I recommend are discounted. Including horror masterpiece The Evil Within 2, which has a ridiculous 85% off discount... incredible! Agreed! I don’t see how a conflict on a global scale benefits anyone! It’s a Zero Sum Game! And I think it would lead to mass anarchy that no government or entity could control. And isn’t that the thing that these authoritarians, globalist and communists fear the most? This has to be the 2 most annoying Twitch streamers of 2023 Spider-Man doesn’t support grooming 🫵 It has come to my attention that the new anime released on Netflix “Scott Pilgrim Takes Off” blatantly race swaps the main character from the original comic, another iconic property infected by the woke mind virus to be “inclusive” and “diverse”. Move to Argentina and become a citizen.  Go. Please.   There's the door. 👉 The trailer for ‘WALLACE & GROMIT: THE GRAND GETAWAY’ VR game has been released. She ain’t said nothing I don’t know. I like anarchy. Let’s go!!!! M- .. Mina, Ochako.. what are u sniffing? would 🙏 Uh yeah? The person I’m replying to seems to agree with that person. Unless you have some different interpretation ? Continuing with my habit of making crossovers of my fave ships, this time asaden x yasugap 🏍 EvanTubeHD vs. THE WORLD 🌎😳  Thought I'd draw myself in this style, i luv it  #ScottPilgrimTakesOff #scottpilgrimfanart Middle class shoplifters partly to blame for rise in retail crime, says Marks & Spencer chairman  🔗 Read more  https://news.sky.com/story/middle-class-shoplifters-partly-to-blame-for-rise-in-retail-crime-says-marks-spencer-chairman-13012811?dcmp=snt-sf-twitter All my playlists are fine on my end. I just checked. No issues. Tim Burton doesn’t want to see any sequels or reboots for ‘THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS’.  “It’s nice that people are maybe interested in another one, but I’m not... Get off of my land! You pesky little… You ain’t getting this property!”  (Source: https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/nightmare-before-christmas-tim-burton-doesnt-want-sequels-reboot-exclusive/) imagine never getting to play Rayman Legends as it was meant to be played. other consoles and PC are nice versions, but...it was even better on Nintendo consoles. Agreed. Most of them never served, have never been in a war zone, have never seen what the civil war they're begging for does to a country.    They think they can have anarchy & THEN go to their jobs, buy food, get gas. They think THEY will be in charge.  Delusion.  No point arguing. This Better Call Saul lawyer doesn’t know how #Twitter works and I’m lol’ing 😂😂😂 You have my utmost respect She gets paid by conservatives and by like-minded people. Like a whole lot. When the grift is over, I wonder what imagine she'll desperately change to to keep up with the money. Follow the blue hair - they are always involved in this crap I just got here and one of my moots is already making hateful comments over an old post I made.  :/  Did you really forget I could still see that, dude? I'm so grateful for these things, otherwise I would never get to play banger games in any way. Wetin do people wey dey use LinkedIn   Abi you jus hear of the app you say make you add am I mean… today is the second to last day of my work week, so for me technically today is my Thursday 🧐🧐😂😂 this probably? 😭 Fact check: True. Obama was able to bring empathy for peoples that are terrorist supporters to the American main stream.  It's not clear whether the world will just devolve into anarchy as terrorism becomes just a condoned tool for political leverage. No moral code left- anything justifiable. Anarchy does not mean chaos, the empire and its states just want you to believe that it would be More Zionists funded Bullshit. Funny how Brock would likely be the one to be the most cool with them them turning things over and being good. And lets be real the idea of Jessie and Delia in his head is payment enough for him and his spank bank lol. You're actually gay. You just use females as an excuse. I KEEP RUNNING OUT OF ROOM HANG ON So just have total anarchy? No officiating either? Just two teams show up and play and make their own rules? Lol Gascón is a Cuban born that came to the US apparently to make LA look like Havana or Caracas. That's a new form of changing West civilization. They make the bad guys run the cities and they become their army. Americans had been taken for a dangerous ride. Chaos and anarchy is their power. I didn’t think anything would top the Silo tv series for me this year, but then Scavengers Reign happened. Fucking Anarchy!  It's Anarchy I tells ya! Oh I don't think that the shift should be longer. I feel like December is barreling down on me like that shitty green screen semi at the end of Sons of Anarchy No, we're not wondering, just you. Pt 1 of my convo w linguist @caitlinmoriah on the Language of G*n0c!de is now available on the main podcast feed.

Listen to our discussion on it here. Literally doing exactly what he just described. Jrue might be the enemy but he don’t deserve that 😑 If you were a decent human being, you would stop playing statism. Keep grifting you glorified welfare recipient. I get what you mean but honestly almost all movies out now don’t require you to watch previous movies or shows to enjoy it. Yes to get a deeper understanding of it all, plus back then marvel didn’t even have a full on plan on how to connect all the movies until like civil war tbh Oh yeah no trolling is famously saying that all workers deserve dignity and workplace safety... Interviewer: do you consider yourself a leader?  Me: yes, I’d definitely be the front of the human centipede   Interviewer: what?  Me: what? Well I guess it depends what the business class is like. Most airlines don't seem to differentiate much nowadays.  I'm going to be in that situation soon. Need to fly with a young one. How the turn tables... All of that is full out lies. You're not interested in helping sex workers. In fact you've admitted elsewhere you're interested in punishing sex workers indirectly. You're harassing Cory because you're clearly opposed to sex workers being treated with dignity. lol I begged legit something for no reason. 😭😭. My parents knew I’d quit instantly. I was cosplaying. Some lovely Avatar Frames have just been uploaded on HoYoLAB 💕 #GenshinImpact #原神 #원신 It's hard to tell if all crypto is a scam, or the government is just targeting crypto because it's corrupt.  On one hand you've got overy corruption like FTX.  On the other hand you've got clear cases of government overreach like @LBRYcom.  The question is, why are so many crypto exchanges acting shady?   Is it standard corporate malfeasance being brought to light by government oversight? Or are the crypto people especially slimy?  It's hard to say for sure. Probably both.  Crypto is new and incredibly profitable. That brings in true believers as well as charlatans/scammers looking for a quick buck.  Long story short: don't trust anyone with your crypto keys. If you don't own it in your own hard wallet, except to lose it one way or another. #OtD 21 Nov 1922 Mexican anarchist communist of Zapotec mestizo descent, Ricardo Flores Magón, died after months of illness and neglect in Leavenworth Prison, Kansas. He was one of the major thinkers and activists of the Mexican revolution https://libcom.org/history/magon-ricardo-flores-1873-1922 Get in line for the shit show lmao They are getting scared, shocked.  They can't stop decentralization.   Decentralization is the future.   Resist the system through $ANA No. Jeez. That website has been like that since what 2008?? These gta accounts are worst conspiracy theorist ever. Probably worse than Alex Jones There is a reason she is best chance VERY likely to be knocked up before she graduates lol. As much as I need this to wait until that date too, I get it lol 😂. I’m not flying American but my airlines will be bombarded 😭 Lol wow you don’t know your philosophy. Nozick was a minarchist not an an cap and the first third of his Anarchy State Utopia argues against anarcho capitalism.   Not to mention that he softened his libertarian views later in life. You're going out of your way to harass Cory. That's not helpful for sex workers. No one cares Anarchy by walton Great stream, very important ending! Poor little Gnat. So angry. So much rage. So exciting. Daddy issues. Clearly  Anytime. Anywhere little one. Might do you the world of good to have a punch bag for a few rounds. You know you like the clashing of bone to flesh. Thats the anarchy in your soul begging to be freed. Sitting down to make an Official Adventure Time TRPG, taking out a copy of D&D5E and staring at it thoughtfully for 16 hours before crossing out "Healing Potion" and writing "Bacon Pancakes" next to it Milei is a crank/clown beyond the libertarian headlines. He's for: Open borders Legalized prostitution and hard drugs Cutting off all support for poor, playing right into communist opposition Etc. The anarchy he supports historically builds a countering totalitarian force. Milei: All In The Family Sanford And Son Sons of Anarchy The Shield So you won't talk with sex workers that disagree with you and you harass and lie about non-sex workers who disagree with you... Interesting. ah, the Wii U, too complex for casual gamers, and too kiddy for hardcore gamers. maybe in another universe.  #fnaf #fnafmovie Sounds like a personal problem, geo A vote for Biden is a vote for anarchy!! Fission power is just sent to the grid as electricity. Most homes are on the grid. Solar is best only for the minority of homes that arent I certainly would! Welcome all.. 🏳️  2011 saw the rise of the Digital Anarchy.  The machine may have been taken away but the culture lives on with $SILK.  You can’t incarcerate culture.  It’s time.  #FreeRoss Missionary so we can share the vape. Also if you aren’t following these people GO FOLLOW THEM GRRRRRR It’s the best drink fr So the next time you try to sell the narrative of western values liberating oppressed Muslim women, you better be prepared to have the door shut in your face. Cool Boom !  #TheAmazingDigitalCircus #TADC Since I’m back here, I wanna shout out some super awesome people who have made my time here actually fucking amazing.  @belgianredacted @Tempest_Torment @TricksterCircus @RaisinTheBlue @cpounpa @Jayden6475 @A_Dizzy_Gamer @gamechanger078 @JorianneFM @AlcoholicDJ_ @Cancer_Lorde_ Sons of Anarchy has to be the most cruddy show of all time surely The game is the game This is why allowing Trump to “run wild” is so dangerous.  Imagine if he’s president, defendants attack judges and witnesses saying, “Well Trump did it”.  We’ll be a country in anarchy with the lead anarchist in the White House. But he funnelled … *checks note* … $1396 to Iran.  https://x.com/macroanarchy/status/1727030694503927912?s=46 if u guys are surprised gumballs voice actor destroyed dream you were NOT there when he killed james charles in minecraft hunger games I never had a Wii U, because at the time my country was a "SPORTS JOCK ONLY XBOX AND PLAYSTATION" Zone, which meant shit was expansive, and rare. 3DS managed to scrape by fine, tho... it was only when the switch came when Nintendo became a legit brand here. There is a very fine line between the anarchy of this human shit and a functionally stable society. In our view, anarchism is the truest form of free market capitalism, and the truest form of free market capitalism is anarchy.  If I were to summarize it in a single word, it would be "consent". All interactions between adults should be consensual. First as tragedy, then as farce. Delusion Childe~~ #childe #tartagli #Genshin Oh man we can watch this live???? Yessss https://piped.video/live/Sw8qlJ2NPS0?si=lJq1O0kwvrl0335M Way more room in those seats which is presumably why people do it.   It's torture to fly economy with kids aged 1-3 unless you hand them a tablet.  Probably shouldn't be in first class but the first row in business/economy should be preserved for kids. More room to move around. reinventing the very concept of a police force. It’s not very smart.  People need to realize: VOTING MATTERS. Running for office matters. I’m tired of this nihilism that many end up succumbing to, just going, “oh it can’t be improved, let’s burn it all down”.  Anarchy never works AINT NO WAY 😭😭😭🤣 He literally said "Let the locals decide". Local sovereignty is a very anarchist position Buff luck for all the Jing Yuan wanter:D #JingYuan #HonkaiStarRail MAGA really means — Make Anarchy Great Again. This is some scary shit my friends. WTF is going on with our country. WTF !!!!! A man with 91 felony ongoing charges and a rape trial soon and threatening judges and prosecutors and potential jurors is the Republican front runner. HAPPENING NOW: Georgia prosecutors are seeking to revoke the bail of Trump codefendant Harrison Floyd, citing incendiary social media posts he made about witnesses in the sprawling racketeering case, including Ruby Freeman. Watch here:  https://piped.video/watch?v=Sw8qlJ2NPS0 Ok this one toi The quality here is so much better than insta bruh #danheng #danhengIL #hsr i cant stop laughing at this. the image of ridley scott slowly sliding a tiny paper hat onto a picture of joaquin phoenix and GASPING I assume all feet tweets are associated with him The little kicky peets ;^; A new #MTG #Commander match!  this time featuring the mighty minotaur Horde! https://piped.video/watch?v=0avmZumQ1GU Rob must’ve tweet that Not just that, social media is a bit of a skill black hole. People who would have spent lots of time fighting others in the street, tinkering with weapons and devices in their garage or barn instead sink hundreds of hours into posting.  Non-digital anarchy skills atrophy. You're very right. Cheers. Really cool that our society produces headlines like this. Couldn’t stop at them as kids, had to do teen designs for them. State of anarchy SAME. Hey guys, please thank Mike Johnson for releasing the J6 tapes. An arrest warrant was issued for another MAGA terrorist. Don't blur them, coward Yay Democrats! Keep voting blue for more crime and less cops. Democrats love murder, mayhem and anarchy. Oh yeah, forgot: overall, it was extremely horrible at the beginning, and gradually became mid by the end. don't watch it, j-j-just, DON'T. The "Shopping Cart Theory" in action. A win for anarchy. I don't have a lot of other options... Which kind of Anarchist seeks, runs for, wins, and serves in a position as the head of a national political apparatus/government?  Anarcho-Politician?   I was pretty sure you couldn't vote and "implement" Anarchy, but I guess I was wrong? Then he turned around lmao what in the Sons of Anarchy hell…. You lot are cruel Of course it's another pastor. i think id prefer anarchy and my own ammunition at this point. I'M HERE TO KICK ASS AND CHEW BUBBLEGUM  AND I'M ALL OUT OF ASS Oh they’re about to watch Sons of Anarchy season 5 episode 6 “small world”. Jax’s downfall began with Opies murder. Time for Jax to get some payback on that prison guard. Revolution: MJF vs Danielson  DoN: Anarchy in the Arena II  Forbidden Door II: Omega vs Ospreay II  All In: Ospreay vs Jericho  All Out: Starks vs Danielson  WrestleDream: Swerve vs Hangman  Full Gear: Swerve vs Hangman II Might not even play until next season tbh. My anarchy and x rank scores are screwed Please open the wiki page of Anarchy, State and Utopia at least. “Beads & Black Girls go together real bad” Been binge watching Sons of anarchy since last night and I wanna double down on my take that this is the best show ever. I’m putting it over Sopranos & Breaking bad Nice try pedo I hope it wasn't also on crack. He has clearly stated his policies regarding his decisions on moving to the US dollar, support, and non-support for certain countries.  None of that was in my Ancap cookbook.  Also, dismantling of those agencies is clearly not within his power if he believes in Anarchy. 🌶️🆕 SADUS - Anarchy https://piped.video/watch?v=64g3zXWhzyA&list=LL&index=10 This IS anarchy in action. 1/3 of "the people" in the world are violent anarchists. You can not fool everyone. Anarchists https://sovren.media/p/263932/68d4cd47e8e7f8102532a844f8e42525 Jay Cutler style IG: cbum Jeez, please at least look up the wiki page of Anarchy, State and Utopia 30 minutes for a lunch is way too short and is frankly ridiculous. This goat just woke up and chose anarchy. LFG ANARCHY 🚀 When he realises the chainsaw isn’t going to work in real life  I didn’t have Anarchy economics making a comeback after Trussenomics I find it interesting that they believe Turning Point to be so far right. I find the content to be normal conservative. Far right would be anarchy in my mind. Part of Nozick's thesis in "Anarchy, State & Utopia" (rest was about John Rawls) was that anarchism doesn't work.  This is the whole anarchist vs minarchist split in libertarianism. The archetypal anarcho-capitalist was Murray Rothbard.  Just say you haven't read Nozick. he DID promise to make a Free Birds video every year. Varoufakis is still insisting on it.

The archetypal anarcho-capitalist was Murray Rothbard. i love winter design It's the kind of feminism that alienates a lot of women because by just being honest with our feelings and desires they accuse us of being self hating. It's a sort of black pill feminism too because they essentialize gender and thus treat patriarchy as inevitable. Nutmeg 17: Burns of the Back Park by @Scott_F_87. “On the muddy training pitches behind Rugby Park in the early 90s, Tommy Burns was melding grunge anarchy with Chicago Bulls’ sporting excellence and earning himself legendary status among Kilmarnock fans and players.” yeah, that. I meant that. I knew he was a lower age than the books and I remembered 23. Mickie and the 2 ladies were already in there when I arrived. Mel came in shortly after me and sat behind them. Mel left 1st alone I think we must generally tread carefully with freedom of expression. This is a very careless tweet to assume people are missing the point.. we get it. But let’s not be careless with our thoughts. A little boy died regardless. Thanks for explaining . It's happening...  going to work leaving work What makes anarchy? Let’s see if you can form an cogent idea. They CAN’T  stop LYING! That I’m a bully No tf I don't. You do tho via demonization of people advocating for all workers' rights. It's kinda like the groomer panickers. They pretend they're opposed to CSA but actually empower it by accusing anyone who advocates for LGBTQ rights. 💖ARTISTS show me how you stylise black hairstyles!!💖 Locs, twists, n puffs BAYBEE!!!!

I'm sorry I have to explain this to you:  THIS ELECTION you have two choices:  1) Vote Dem retain Democracy 2) Vote Republican introduce Fascism.   Anarchy is not a choice in the US.  Never will be. He was a minarchist, take a look in in Anarchy, State, and Utopia. What is your source? Is it… you? 📀ARTISTS show me how you stylize  black hairstyles 📀  One of my favorite things to draw and stylize is dreads/braids because you can always use fun shaped with them 😼 This is so wrong to say   They’ll start anarchy You don't owe the gvmt anything, you owe it to the society. Gvnmts are supposed to be nothing but the administrators of the national wealth created by ordinary people. Civilised & humane society isn't fascim. Since you prefer anarchy set up your own society & finance it yourself. I'm guessing the "ind" in her tweet is short for indirectly. She could have phrased it better...with less emotion. That's true But you're NOT asking new questions. You're trying to convince people to believe like you by asking questions you already have answered for yourself. It's manipulative. If you were interested in changing your beliefs you'd just say what you believe and invite criticism. how much does she know I’m very professional, as you can see😂 That depends lol No need to lie on internet I just learned there are people calling themselves anarcho capitalist? Are you fucking stupid. I hate how anarchy based ideologies are now just used to be edgier versions of trad capitalists. Y’all out here writing dissertations??? Isn’t that better phrased than directly accusing the president of murder? On a side note, I have even MORE respect for court reporters that do live updates, because I have no idea how they get out such accurate posts so quickly. I was using my best waitress writing just to scribble out the basics Look at this shit! Right before they full on slander you they admit that there's some women who would do sexual labor! Yes, I agree the vast majority of sex workers would prefer to be liberated from work! That's basically all workers tho. And just completely ignoring what I said. The engineer gives more credit to the potential of seeing Brainiac in Superman Legacy. My understanding. ZNS wouldn't and shouldn't have gone where they went to do what they did if there was food security in the nation. So, the death of the teenager was indirectly caused by the inability of the president and his cabinet to ensure food security. It sure is lucky we have all these free speech absolutists like you on Twitter to tell all of us exactly what's fraud and what isn't. They better do so. Before they send the nation into Anarchy. GM Anarchy legend Morning Tell me you've never read "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" without telling me you've never read "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" My man just saw "anarchy" in the title of one of Nozick's books and concluded "yep, anarchist."

Anarchy, derived from a Greek word meaning "having no ruler," is a belief system that rejects governmental authority in favor of self-governing or community consensus that has become a synonym for chaos and the breakdown of civil order. Only 43 days until $ANA launch, last phase of the presale! State of Anarchy?? It seems it’s the demoncraps that are the most violent.

Mod Anarchy 2.0 😁 I’m intrigued People responding mungulikali to this tweet without understanding what she's saying.

This isn’t normal. Residential areas aren’t supposed to be hit during a “war” military aren’t supposed to fight civilians.   This isn’t normal. Please don’t get used to seeing this, don’t let your brain settle into thinking this is inevitable or normal.   A refugee camp. LISTEN. There are 3 options. 1.

Gm anarchy 🌮 And that is why the Anarchy route in Shin Megami Tensei IV Apocalypse is the worst ending in all of mainline SMT. Nice trick  Pretending to do law enforcement event while your city falls into anarchy   And you can put all your effort into punishing political opponents.   Does it feel like a real LE job? Or do you have a hard time fooling yourself The anarchist "essence" has been promoted culturally by the left - no gods, no masters, no family members who disagree with your politics - and economically by the right for years, yet we're further away from political anarchy than ever. Bigness is in and here to stay. They are getting desperate.   The matrix is looking for any excuse to bring down cryptocurrency.   They can't control it, so they want to bring it down.

The judge tells him he doesn’t know what that means in regards to this case, but if that’s what he wants to say, then fine. It sure is pointless because you mistakenly think the c-trains will run through residential areas and they won't.  You're the one who is close minded because your mind is stuck on the train and the article is about secondary suites. I doubt you even take city transit. Eepiest gal IT'S TIME I had no life jacket...

Guistino seemed offended by the $10 and looks at the prosecutor oh my fucking god guys i showed my male friend splatoon (1,2, and 3) and the ost (kraken up, aquasonic, paintscrapper, anarchy rainbow, and ripstop go) and he told me he likes the songs and he will buy himself a nintendo switch and splatoon 3 i fucking won in life #Splatoon Friend I didn’t … I really didn’t We have a problem.

He rightfully calls our haven “Home”.   A living, breathing example of our mantra, he took the time to share his thoughts with us. Sounds like poor scheduling.

ATEEZ COMEBACK NEXT WEEK ?!??? i guess i’ll have to start bleaching State of anarchy State of no-go zones It is coming to areas plagued by this behavior. there’s just something about fine handsome men with beautiful smiles in their early 30s……….❤️😮‍💨 I agree with you 💯 🤣 Do you want a Third Century Anarchy?  Because this is how you get a Third Century Anarchy . . . Plus, it’s not like there isn’t precedence for it being a hit. Sons of Anarchy and Mayans have been big hits what is Hegel's solution to the paradox of "Negative Liberation"? Not endless usurpation of factions by other factions (revolutions) or anarchy, but the certainty of a morality inspired by direct knowledge of certain death.

How gaping is his asshole after how much shit he pulled from it? Quit using “anarchy” as a synonym for lawlessness! Look at the roots: a(n) = against, archon = ruler.

At last hearing, Judge says he was offensive,inappropriate, and disrespectful. Guistino sent several emails to the govt & claims it was a “cry for answers” The true crime podcast/documentary is taking me out 😭 When the anarchy starts, will the judiciary go to the battle front?  You don’t have the balls to do the needful so all of you should get out Really, that's your experience in day to day life? Everyone is suppressing the urge to eat you because they fear collective punishment?  Almost all human interactions are conducted in the state of Anarchy.

Anarchy is the base template of life, don't hurt me and I won't hurt you. We all practice this everyday in real life. Monarchy was created, Democracy was created, these are all ideas and customs, enforced by some on others. The NE states got greater autonomy than anywhere in the mainland and that's the root cause of all the problems with riots and all. Autonomy is good but more autonomy in unchecked manner leads to anarchy.

You are stuck in a close minded framework this is a pointless conversation Some Algerian Muslims in France attacked French teenagers with knives during a party in Crepol. Several injured and one dead, Thomas, 16 years old. They hate us. I believe you are conflating the word 'anarchy' with 'mental disorder', ie; the anarchy of your thoughts.

The law abiding people turn them in and then it is anarchy. Most of the worst areas for gun violence have strict gun laws. Did you see my post of the kids in Chicago sporting fully auto Glocks?  There is enough information in that post to identify, find, and prosecute. Think that will actually happen? Not a chance. Why? Because the government is corrupt. That brings me to the sole reason you should stay armed. Our government hates us, the only reason we are not worse off is they also fear us. While I feel bad for anarchy these cultural enriches have brought to western countries, there is still a question: why did west exploit Africa so badly without giving back enough to survive. 13 is the number of anarchy 😭 so sad somehow FIFTY EIGHT?!!!?????!!?

Stick to being faithful to ANA and we will achieve everything that we desire/deserve. More simple?

Side note, I wonder how many of the right wingers who think anarchy is based also support the police 🤦🏻‍♂️ Fuck yea @RecTheRegime! K-mart 🤣 I don’t think so I think it's important to use the right words so people can agree on what they're talking about. And I think there's a difference between authority and hierarchy  What would you do if I tried to impose hierarchy in an anarchist society? Season 2 of Blue Eye Samurai is about to give: Look at the anarchy and violence...!!! @DalrympleWill I just wanted to say I’ve been listening to Empire and it is simply brilliant.

Fine.  But if they strip us off all of our trophies since 2008 that's where I'll begin to have serious problems. "The people of the Nok Culture must have come from somewhere else. So far, however, we have not found out what region, though we suspect the Sahel zone in West Africa, fairly far away from the known extent of the Nok Culture" "The earliest period (Early Nok), already mentioned above, lasted from 1500 BCE to 900 BCE and is defined by pottery decorated with finely incised or impressed straight or wavy patterns covering most of the pots’ surface."  - Peter Breunig I'm sorry he's the minister of what-now? I know he’d be on Method Man level of fine if he was still alive 😩 Cooking Twerp (1/2) Judge had warned Guistino last time that if he didn’t show up for sentencing, a warrant would be issued and he would sentence him more harshly. He was revived max 6 months This man was perfection on my eyes okay. Literal perfection. Gorgeous for no reason Apparently, they are okay with another partition-like situation, including riots all over India. Words like revolution, instability, anarchy, etc. sound orgasmic to them. Ikr? Rockstar might have changed them! Because the game is still in development. Anarchist Essay #68!  In the latest episode of our podcast series w/@arglboro, @carneross argues that 'Anarchy is Love'  This essay first appeared in @DSPDOPE.  Listen here, or search for 'Anarchist Essays' https://bit.ly/3G6Lukt The judge said that at his last hearing, Guistino had the worst behavior he’s seen thus far from a J6er and could have held him in contempt of court back then. I’m not a turd and I’m for a better way for humanity based on locality. Problems in US aren’t the same in Asia, Africa etc. Problems in New York aren’t same as those in Ohio.  I’m for democracy with the locals making decisions and improving their communities. Sort of real Anarchy You are no longer allowed to have this word in your bio. This represents anarchy and yet you are on the side of some 'new world [gender] order', betraying your own dictum. You either embrace anarchy or are profiteering off it simply as a slogan. Definitely both. You scare me. Sorry I’m all out of funds Portland teachers are on strike and marching this morning.   The Burnside bridge is temporarily closed. What do you have against fruit? Son’s of anarchy rocked❤️❤️ Wonder if Mel ever heard about how Mickie called her a slut for sleeping with a married man? Mickie and Mel Hawley were there. Also 2 other women and 1 of them was crying and blowing kisses at Guistino and saying she loved him DIVERSITY: Shortly after a Navy P-8A overshot the runway and landed in Kaneohe Bay (everyone survived) I pointed out that the crew was diverse. For that I got a scathing community note saying it wasn’t true. The Navy is very proud of the fact that it’s P-8 fleet features the most diverse crews in military aviation. 1st Lt. Hailey Harms, a Marine spokesperson confirmed the crew was both diverse and alive. Because the MSM isn’t reporting the identity of the crew the community notes community decided my comment was wrong. Annoying and false. Before you apply a community note make sure you know what you’re talking about - your inability to confirm a statement isn’t proof it isn’t accurate. Note: This crew photo is just the one the Navy distributed to show how diverse its P-8 crews are. They did not share one of the P-8 crew that went for a swim. I’m not going lie! Some of y’all shouldn’t have platforms. Y’all are just mean spirited people disguised as allies and it’s weird! A centralized hierarchy and an authority might as well be synonymous for me. I care less about which word we choose to use and more about the content of what anarchist beliefs actually entail He was already in custody for not showing up to his original sentencing. A bench warrant had been issued and they picked him up recently. He’s at the jail but not yet at CTF which is the “gulag” Your scale is bullshit. There is total control (tyranny) on the left end and total anarchy (zero government) on the extreme right. Lots of weird people out there Martian.  Social Media; The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. What if we kissed in the beer cave?

I wonder what kind of mental gymnastics they’ll do to act like it’s no big deal. I attended his sentencing today. He got 90 days with 30 days time served No, but they do already by virtue of the Charter and NBHRA? Or are you talking about anarchy? Just wondering.

We at the Libertarian Party support the freedom to express all speech.   Good on Thomas Massie for standing up for freedom, even if opens the door to criticism. Heroism is based on the world view of the individual. He’s a hero because as a child he stood up to protect and aid people in complete anarchy. He’s also a villain because he was supposed to let terrorist destroy and take over cities according to other world views. Not with strong people who are informed and  engaged.

(Goal:£2,200.0) https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/anarchy54/war-war-war-an-anarchy-54-game That's a bit more complex than just authority. What you're describing sounds more like a centralized hierarchy, a social system built around authority, as you said, not the concept of authority itself not because I've done sex work but when I said that I'd dabbled here and there in amateur sex content for the fun of it. The idea that there's room for sexual labor sans exploitation kinda ruins their entire schtick. Although "Arab-Berber" tribes dominate the region in modern times, archaeological evidence indicates that the culture found at Dhar Tichitt was founded by Mande speaking peoples, most likely the Soninke.

It's the same aggressive hyperbole used by the anti-abortion crowd. They're not actually in favor of liberation. They're authoritarians co-opting the language of liberatory political philosophies and movements to further their end. I suspect they didn't want to argue with me Marcus Rashford vs North Macedonia  Top class cameo 👏 There is only one way of being safe when you live in a messed up anarchy surrounded by uncouth people:You are under protection of a lord/employer,your tribe,your clan,your like-proffesion guilds and unions.

My man. $SILK 🏳️  Digital Anarchy has begun.   @silkroaderc #FreeRoss #Silk #SILKROAD Well.. What an exciting afternoon for all of us $ATOR holders seeing some uncharacteristic downwards action, I had almost forgotten what red candles looked like!  Firstly congratulations and well done to those that have held their nerve amongst this barrage of fud and the recent developments. 🤝  To clarify for those not in the know, ToR was NEVER a necessity of $ATOR it would have been liked to have been endorsed but was never a necessity. ToR have shown their hand over the last few days, exposing their aged attitude towards resisting development and progress within their existing network, and now it is time for $ATOR to really stretch their legs. I would encourage people to hold their nerve and ride this out, but as always #NFA and you are free to make your own decisions based on the facts.  I have had confirmation from within the team that they will be forking ToR and carrying on with development but under their own peer to peer network, promising  better bandwidth, higher speeds, top end security and of course rewards for relay runners as was the original plan, without the political ties and handcuffs associated with the ToR network. What has taken ToR 20 years to build will take $ATOR a matter of months and this has been proven already in testnet phase.  These are an unfortunate set of events but ToR have played their cards and the team will progress without them, I wish ToR all the best.  Below is a statement released by the @atorprotocol team no more than 30 mins ago outlining their intentions. As outlined in the attached, the news that all of the fudders and little CT gremlins have crawled out from their rocks from to spread, has set the project back in price by a mere 30 days and if that doesn't confirm the strength and depth once again of this team then I'm not sure what will. The fact that other projects are SOOO desperate to try and tear $ATOR down is incredibly bullish in my opinion!  https://medium.com/@atorprotocol/building-the-future-of-internet-privacy-a-new-vision-3513454f602d Authority isn’t some benign use of force or imposition of will. Authority is first and foremost a social system which creates a centralized flow of power where one group is privileged with domain and control over a subordinate and exploited party Since the birth of Anarchism as a distinct political ideology, "Anarchy" has not meant simply "without rulers" Oh so now authority is when centralized social system? Thats not the definition you gave, its almost like you are manipulating words to suit your ends Feeling cute might delete later. Stood in the post office line today talking to the chap behind me as we awaited serving, Suddenly realised folk might have taken it as a sign for anarchy to ensue so just in time I looked straight ahead and fell into stony stoical silence. All risk was averted, I’ll never learn. One time transfer is far from anarchy. Stop clutching your pearls coach. Not out of nowhere. I read your words and put your beliefs together. Stop being a coward and just say that you already have reached your conclusions. Stop doing a fake Socratic method. You're just being manipulative. Anarchy truly is the most stable system of all systems we know. That one voluntarily read this tweet and considers whether or not they agree shows that they are participating in anarchy right now. 99% of a person's daily interactions with other people are anarchistic in nature. No, your administration is through excess taxation, excess spending, and excess inflation. Stfu tyrant. “Actually resisting authority is itself authority bro, I am very smart and worth taking seriously”.   How does throwing a brick at a cop car create a centralized social system? This is ADL's game:  Their key weapon is the anti-semitism accusation. Once they pin that to someone's forehead, the only way out is give ADL what they want.  Usually it's cash. But with Musk, they extracted something more valuable: banning of political slogans Israel dislikes. Because we still believe in natural justice. The patience to discern good and evil and the ability to withstand the time to get the evil punished naturally is civilization's wisdom to avoid anarchy as is witnessed largely. my eyes have been opened, i gotta experience the art in its truest form kinger has been involved in a tragic car crash‼️‼️ CAUGHT ON TAPE  pomni is not a good driver  #TheAmazingDigitalCircus #TADC #Kinger #Pomni This account has been harassing @Skepticallefty for like 2 days.

Total Anarchy from @FRONTMANJAH 💪💪 It was an honor to be part of this tournament, sharing the ring with Connors and Shire, and winning it all was a very special moment for me. Wow. Pete Buttigieg just responded to Mike Johnson saying his same-sex marriage is the “dark harbinger of chaos and sexual anarchy” that will destroy the country. That people ostensibly fighting for the rights and dignity of sex workers keep harassing you, insisting you're doing something wrong, shows they're not interested in protecting sex workers. They're interested in punishing them. @Uppolice: Anti-Muslim hate activities must b addressed promptly. Every citizen deserves a safe & inclusive environment.

(They failed for the 4th time)  2022- Members of my own party and members of the left called and emailed the DHS to try and stop us from adopting the newborn baby brother of my oldest daughter and two adopted children. (It worked and the judge granted his foster parents custody while we were over half way done with their programs they required)   2021- Members of my own party and members of the left screenshot and sent my tweets and portions of my show to my job to try and get me fired. (They failed for a 3rd time)  2020- Members of my own party and members of the left used my oldest daughter as a weopon to try and hurt me by contacting her and her drug addled mother while I was trying to get full custody (for 10 years) and offering them money while in a bad situation to make bad statements about me while I was running for Chairman of the LNC. 4 months later, I would get full custody of my daughter and her two younger siblings who were not mine biologically, and she felt horrible. The same people would go on to calling DHS to try and get those kids taken away from us. (They failed)  Early 2020- Members of my own party and members of the left would reach out to my now wife while she was pregnant with our first son, and try to get her to leave me. They told her I was going to take the baby back to California and fight her for custody. They told her I was abusive and a nazi, etc. (They failed)  2019- Members of my own party would try to get me fired from my job. (They failed for a second time)   2018- Members of my own party concocted stories from nazism to sexual abuse, to harassment during my first LNC Chair run. Publications would run these stories in print and my job got hold of them. If it wasn't for my good receipt keeping, I would have been destroyed. Those people would have to go on to print retractions and apologies. (They failed for the first time)  Politics is a dirty, disgusting game where people do things to others in secret what they would never say or do to their faces. They will try and ruin your actual life over perceived differences of ideology and opinion. They will use your children, your familes, your livelihoods, etc. All for their own political game. It's one of the reasons I hate politics so much.   I am running to beat @RecTheRegime And I intend to do that, but being pulled from a publisher that supposedly prides itself on free speech for perceived differences of foreign policy opinion is disgusting. They and whoever pushed for this should be ashamed of themselves.   I'm sorry that Michael has to deal with this. That’s more like it "'mere' anarchy is loosed upon the world."

Lol lmao. You're just an anti vaxxer and a centrist. You're not asking genuine questions. You've reached your conclusions. You're opposed to trans youth medical care, you're already opposed to Medicare for All. You are just JAQing off... I.e. anarchists argue that power should be shared amongst a freely associated rank and file. Violence toward that end wouldn’t constitute authority in the same sense as using violence to reinforce some centralized schema where elites have all the power. I need!!!!!! We could debate it and agree on 90% of the nonsense. Unfortunately, we are debating people who can't differentiate between a man and a woman.

Huh. The LAPD riot squad is out in front of a mansion hosting a Kamala Harris’ fundraiser. To protect rich donors from people calling for a ceasefire. Who is we? Because you were talking about blaming the mother and calling her a coward who hates children. Don’t change your narrative. Tough shit, losers. Get to work. Is my maths wrong? If, instead of GIVING Rwanda £140 million, the UK had employed 3,500 people to work on asylum applications at two each per week over a 40 week year they could have cleared the asylum backlog and saved £2.9 BILLION (8 million per day on hotels). I’ve got mutuals id drink many beers with and I got mutuals I hope I have a taser if I ever run into them. Some of y'all need theory and it shows...
