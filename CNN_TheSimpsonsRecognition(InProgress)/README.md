# Image Classification with TensorFlow and Keras (The Simpsons Characters, In Progress)

This code imports modules and sets up the environment for an image classification project using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Imports

- warnings - to ignore warning messages
- os - for operating system functions
- numpy - for numerical data
- cv2 - OpenCV computer vision library
- tensorflow - machine learning framework  
- keras - high level TensorFlow APIs
- keras.preprocessing.image - image loading and augmentation
- keras.optimizers - optimization algorithms like Adam
- keras.callbacks - callbacks like ModelCheckpoint
- plotly.subplots - plotting module
- plotly.graph_objs - plotly graph objects

## Configuration  

- Ignore all warnings
- Disable some TensorFlow optimizations for compatibility

## Overview

The imports bring in the key Python libraries needed for loading image data, building and training neural network models with TensorFlow and Keras, augmenting the data, optimizing the models, saving checkpoints, and plotting results.

The configuration sets up the environment - ignoring warnings and disabling certain TensorFlow optimizations.

Overall, this setup provides the foundation to build an image classifier using deep learning and convolutional neural networks in TensorFlow and Keras.
